## Fragment shader
Started to learn more about shaders (thanks to this awesome book: [The Book of shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/))
After playing around I wanted to add the shadows of Threejs lights, so here's the example.
If you just want the fragment shader, look to fragmentShaders.js at the lights string.
Note that when there is no light in the scene the shader will still be visible.
